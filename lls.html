    <p>The chief actor of the cartoon &quot;wolf and spice&quot;, a 25 year old businessman traveling around the country living in business. Because he met the girl named &quot;virtuous wolf&quot;, he changed his lonely business life. He was often fooled by his cunning speech, the events of verbal communication and common experience made him and his fetters more and more deep, and gradually revealed the other side besides the &quot;good calculating businessman&quot;.</p>
