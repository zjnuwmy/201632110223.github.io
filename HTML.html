	 <strong><span>HTML</span>:</strong><span>HTML</span> is the abbreviation of hypertext markup language,it is an application under <span>standard General Markup Language</span>( An international standard language that defines the structure of electronic documents and describes their contents).     <span>Hypertext refers</span> to non text elements that contain pictures, links, and even music, programs, and so on.

   <h2>Origin</h2>
   The <strong>essence</strong> of web pages is <span>hypertext markup language</span>, which can create powerful web pages by using other Web technologies (such as scripting language, public gateway interface, components and so on). Therefore, <span>hypertext markup language</span> is the foundation of the world wide web (Web) programming, that is to say, the world wide web is based on hypertext. <span>Hypertext markup language</span> is called <strong>hypertext markup language</strong> because the text contains the so-called "hyperlink" point.<br>
   <h2>Definiton</h2>
  <span>Hypertext markup language</span> is an application of standard general markup language. It is also a standard. It marks all parts of the web page which is <strong>displayed by mark symbol</strong>. Web page file itself is a text file, <strong>by adding markup in the text file, you can tell the browser how to display the contents</strong> (such as: how the text processing, how to arrange the picture, how to display the picture, etc.). The browser reads the web page in sequence, and then explains and displays the contents of the tag according to the token. 
  <br><strong>For different browsers, there may be different interpretations of the same token, which may have different display effects.</strong>
  <h2>Writing style</h2>
  It's actually text, it needs a browser's explanation, and its editor can be roughly divided into three types.<br>
  <strong>1.Basic text, document editing software</strong><br>using Microsoft's own notebook or writing board can be written, of course, if you use WPS to write, also can. However, use.Htm or.Html as an extension when you save it, so that the browser recognizes the direct interpretation and execution.<br>
  <strong>2.Semi - visible software</strong><br>
  Such as: FCK-Editer, E-webediter and other online web page editors;<br>
  Especially recommended: Sublime Text code editor (developed by Jon Skinner, Sublime Text 2, but can be probed indefinitely).<br>
  <strong>3.With the most widely used editor</strong><br> you can make a web page without a little knowledge of HTML, such as:<br>
  AMAYA (product unit: World Wide Web Alliance);<br>
  FRONTPAGE (product unit: Microsoft);<br>
  Dreamweaver (product unit: Adobe).</div>

     These are just about the concept, and the<a href="HTML2.html"> next is the real look of the web!</a></div>
