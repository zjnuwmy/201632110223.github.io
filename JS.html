     <h3>Learning web development basic technology needs to know three sowrds: <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span> and <span>JavaScript language</span>.</h3>
<strong><span>JS</span>:</strong><span>JavaScript a literal scripting language, a dynamic type, a weak type, a prototype based language, and a built-in support type. Its interpreter is called JavaScript engine. It is a script language widely used for the client part of browser. It was first used in HTML (Standard General Markup Language Application). It is used on Web pages to add dynamic functions to HTML pages.</span><br></div>

   <h2>Basic characteristics</h2>
   <p>JavaScript is a script language belonging to the network. It has been widely used in Web application development. It is commonly used to add various dynamic functions to web pages, and provide users with more fluent and beautiful browsing effect. Usually JavaScript scripts are embedded in HTML to implement their own functions.<br>
     <strong>1.</strong>It is an interpretative scripting language (code is not precompiled).<br>
     <strong>2.</strong>It is mainly used to add interactive behavior to the HTML (an application under the standard General Markup Language).<br>
     <strong>3.</strong>It can be directly embedded in HTML pages, but writing a separate JS file is beneficial to the separation of structure and behavior. <br>
     <strong>4.</strong>Cross platform features, with the support of most browsers, can run on a variety of platforms (such as Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS, etc.).<br>
   The Javascript scripting language, like other languages, has its own basic data types, expressions and arithmetic operators and the basic program framework of the program. Javascript provides four basic data types and two special data types for processing data and text. And the variable provides the place where the information is stored, and the expression can perform more complex information processing.</p>
   <h2>Other characteristics</h2>
   <p><strong>(1) scripting language. </strong>JavaScript is an interpretive scripting language, and languages such as C, C++ are compiled and executed first, while JavaScript is interpreted line by line in the process of running the program.<br>
     <strong>(2) based on objects.</strong> JavaScript is an object based scripting language that can not only create objects but also use existing objects.<br>
     <strong>(3) simple.</strong> JavaScript language uses weak type variable types, and does not make strict demands on the data type used. It is a script language based on Java basic statement and control, and its design is simple and compact.<br>
     <strong>(4) dynamic. </strong>JavaScript is an event driven scripting language that does not need to respond to user input without a Web server. When accessing a web page, mouse can click, move up and down and move windows in web pages. JavaScript can directly respond to these events.<br>
   <strong>(5) cross platform.</strong> The JavaScript scripting language is not dependent on the operating system and requires only the support of the browser. Therefore, a JavaScript script can be used to any machine when it is written. On the premise, the browser on the machine supports JavaScript script language. At present, JavaScript has been supported by most browsers.</p>
